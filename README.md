# neural_unitvector
A Feed-forward Neural Network trained to learn a vector normalisation function.

This will generate x number of random points in three dimensional space at the x dataset and normalise them for the y dataset, the end result is a network that can easily reproduce a fairly accurate vector normalisation function.
